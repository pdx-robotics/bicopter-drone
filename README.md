It's a bicopter drone. 
Hello! Welcome to the Viking Robotics Flying/Swimming Bicopter project!
This is a two-rotor flying machine that will eventually swim. An example of a working bicopter can be [seen here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hfss7nCN40A "Bicopter").

Another one can be [seen here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot3Em2lI9y8 "Bicopter Deuce").

The first step is to get the thing built and flying. The second step is to get it waterproofed and swimming. But one thing at a time! 

Currently we are designing the parts in our various CAD programs and assembling the entire thing on OnShape. The link to our full assembly is [here](http://onshape.com "OnShape assembly").

The code/firmware will be compiled with Mission Planner of the [Ardupilot project](http://ardupilot.org/planner/ ("Misson Planner Home")

This is only a bare-bones readme. Will update it as the project goes on!
