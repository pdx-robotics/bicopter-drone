Hello! Welcome to the Viking Robotics Flying/Swimming Bicopter project!
This is a two-rotor flying machine that will eventually swim. An example of a working bicopter can be [seen here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hfss7nCN40A "Bicopter").

Another one can be [seen here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot3Em2lI9y8 "Bicopter Deuce").

The first step is to get the thing built and flying. The second step is to get it waterproofed and swimming. But one thing at a time! 

Currently, we have a Lexan frame we cut at the Electronics Prototyping Lab that we will begin mounting electronics to shortly. We will use this to test hardware functionality as well as get in a few flights! We are calling it the "squidcopter" because it resembles a squid when first coming from the laser cutter. 

Next, we are designing the parts in our various CAD programs and assembling the entire thing on OnShape. We will 3D print them and assemble a more "polished" bicopter. The link to our full assembly is [here](http://onshape.com "OnShape assembly").

The code/firmware will be compiled with Mission Planner of the [Ardupilot project](http://ardupilot.org/planner/ "Misson Planner Home")

This is only a bare-bones readme. Will update it as the project goes on! 

NEXT STEP IN THE PROJECT: 

The next step is to connect all the existing electronics and see if they respond to tilts, rolls, remote commands and etc. 

If they do, we will work on making and printing up the frame!
